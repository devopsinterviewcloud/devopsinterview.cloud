# How to Remove the "Coming Soon" Banner

When you're ready to remove the temporary "Coming Soon" banner, follow these simple steps:

## Option 1: Quick Removal (Recommended)

Edit `/root/DevopsInterview.Cloud/devopsinterview-cloud/src/app/layout.tsx`

**Remove this line:**
```tsx
import { ComingSoonBanner } from "@/components/ComingSoonBanner";
```

**And remove this line:**
```tsx
<ComingSoonBanner />
```

## Option 2: Complete Cleanup

1. **Remove the import and component** (same as Option 1)

2. **Delete the banner component file:**
   ```bash
   rm src/components/ComingSoonBanner.tsx
   ```

3. **Rebuild the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Files Modified for the Banner

- ✅ `src/components/ComingSoonBanner.tsx` - The banner component
- ✅ `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added banner import and component
- ✅ `src/app/page.tsx` - Changed navigation from `fixed` to `sticky` and reduced hero padding

## Notes

- The banner appears on **all pages** (home, privacy, terms, contact, refunds)
- It's positioned at the very top with a gradient blue-purple-indigo background
- The banner is **sticky** so it stays visible when scrolling
- No database or API changes were made

That's it! The banner will be completely removed once you follow Option 1 or 2.
